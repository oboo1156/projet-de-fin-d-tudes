# Final year project of a counseling app (projet-de-fin-d-tudes)
the app is about students/clients posting their problems and counsellors help them by commenting and dm'ing students
so basically only counsellors can dm u any other reply should be in the comment section
Client names will be anonymous to everyone else but counsellors and not even mere peer counsellors can know your full details
Details of client is confidential. Just like the Jodel app, anyone can share their story but what make our app different
is that you get counsellors who will talk to you and call you one on one to help you out and we get to see matured advise
from trained people and not just anyone
